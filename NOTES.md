# Strategy

Ideally, we could take any recipe, online or on paper and convert it into a
mise-en-plot. To make this easy, we'll start with digital first recipes. To
make this easier still, we'll start with the fairly standardized recipe format
from one of the more common meal kit companies: Blue Apron.

There are a series of stages needed to make this work:

```
Source     Parsed       Flow           Visual
Recipe --> images   --> Structured --> Format
           and text     Data
```

Because things only become useful in the last step, we'll target that step
first, manually providing the needed input.
