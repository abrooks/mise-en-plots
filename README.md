# mise-en-plots

_Mise en plots_ is a play on _mise en place_ (roughly, "putting in place"), a
term from the cullinary world describing the practice of the preperation and
layout of the ingredients needed to make a meal. This project aims to provide
graphical representations, "plots" as it were, to show the flow of ingredients
for those of us who are more visual and get lost in written directions.

Current recipe formats are not only hard to visually scan quickly (particularly
for some) but do not help the user to see options for parallelism in
activities, identify the long time involved paths, give a sense of bowl / pot
usage through preparation or adapt to the needs of the user (someone who is
slow at dicing or someone who cannot easily manage multiple tasks at once,
etc.).

This project aims to automatically take conventional recipes and turn them into
plots (DAGs, directed acyclic graphs) showing the flow of ingredients across
their preparation into the resulting meal.
